things that imho would be worth having
and also reminder of others.

# linux kernel related (this should be in the next kernel released)
- palmwkbd.c (from hackndev) adds support for 4 row palm wireless keyboard.
- reduction of booting time (~ 30 sec) replacing udev by device files.
- fix to the random stylus touch bug. 

# t3 port related
- corrected touchscreen calibration.
- /dev/audio from audio-oss.c works both from input and output (use them).
- added double click to touchscreen stylus so windows can be hidden/raised in wm.
- added a "blank" command (apm_blank() ) to /dev/apm, the screen is unblank by pressing a key.
- graphics can be managed by the framebuffer, but things are a bit more complicated
  when handling input from touchscreen (both stylus & keys) as it's more model dependent,
  find a good way to manage this.

# inferno related
- jit doesn't work in T3, as far i've tested (improvement in performance): 
  the behaviour is that when loading a dis module it segfaults.
- mc and fc hang up, /appl/cmd/mc.b:2389 : return sys->sprint("%g") results in hang,
  changing it to "%f" results in a segfault on /emu/port/alloc.c:/^dopoolalloc(),
  by now workaround using "%d", find the real reason.
