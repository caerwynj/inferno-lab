<pre><b>NAME</b>
     Inferno emu on Palm Tungsten T3<i> (and</i><i> under</i><i> similar</i>
     <i>palm</i><i> handhelds,</i><i> see</i><i> notes).</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     This lab collects some personal/informal notes
     that I took while setting up setup Inferno emu
     running hosted on a T3, the main reasons for doing
     this are:

     1.   Wanted to experiment with <a href="http://www.vitanuova.com">Inferno</a>

     2.   Get tired of the 'traditional' way of using a
          computer and by extension a handheld (both
          POS and Linux), and wanting to employ my time
          in more useful things.

     3.   after some time using Inferno i've noticed
          that it has all i need, and the pieces that
          Inferno doesn't have (ogg, mp3, etc.) can be
          borrowed from the host OS (Linux).

     The first section covers the hardware available on
     the T3, the second section talks about how to
     setup Linux on the T3, and finishes talking about
     the setup of Inferno itself to perform some
     typical tasks, which includes brief notes on how
     to compile and run emu on T3.

  <b>Hardware</b>
     I'm going to center in the hardware that is
     currently <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/PalmTungstenT3Status">supported</a> under Linux, and hence
     available for Inferno hosted, there are some good
     reviews about the T3 one that it's worth mention
     is <a href="http://www.pspilot.de/ppptun3/ppptun3.html">ppptun3</a>

     In summary we can use:

     -    SD card support for storage

     -    a nice 320x480 TFT LCD for graphics

     -    audio support both for playing and recording

     -    and buttons and touchscreen for input

     -    networking: we have are usb (usbnet), IR (not
          tested, but should work) and BT (not working
          due to lack of specs).

     It's important to note that T3 as the other palm
          handhelds have reset features that are useful
          to recover of some errors, you can read about
          at<a href="http://www.tankerbob.com/palm/resets.htm"> resets.</a>

  <b>Setting</b><b> up</b><b> Linux</b>
  <b>Booting</b>
     The procedure for booting Inferno can be sumarized
     in:
     <b>1) boot POS (default from ROM) -></b>
     <b>2)	run Garux (from SD Card, 1st partition FAT16) -></b>
     <b>3)		start Linux (using rootfs from 1st partition of SD Card) -></b>
     <b>4)			start Inferno emu-fb (from a /etc/init.d/inferno script)</b>

     As Garux is run from Palm OS (POS), the SD card
     where garux is stored needs to be recognized from
     POS, which has a FAT16, hence maximum tested SD
     card size is 1Gb.

     This 1Gb SD card can be partitioned the following
     way,

          <i>part1</i> FAT16 30Mb, to store garux and the
          rootfs, kernel modules and other files needed
          to boot Linux.

          <i>part2</i> ext3 970Mb, to store Inferno and media
          (audio,docs,...).

     All the files and a small howto with instructions
     on how to boot Linux on a T3 can be found at <a href="http://trac.hackndev.com/projects/palmt3/wiki/">t3</a>
     <a href="http://trac.hackndev.com/projects/palmt3/wiki/">linux</a> On the same place there's a guide to flash
     the SmallRom partition which holds the POS
     bootloader, to be able to suspend/resume the T3,
     otherwise you have to reset the handheld each time
     you want to power off and booting again takes it's
     time.

  <b>Setting</b><b> up</b><b> Inferno</b>
     Given the hardware available on T3 (and handhelds
     in general) it's wise to keep the system as small
     and simple as possible. So the hardware devices
     are managed by the linux kernel, which provices
     access to them through the<b> /dev/</b> devices;<b> /dev/fbX</b>
     for the graphics frame buffer,<b> /dev/input/eventX</b>
     for input events (touchscreen and keys) and 
     <b>/dev/dsp</b> for audio. This devices can be managed by
     the emu-fb version written by Alexander Syschev
     for the iPAQ 3970 (arm) and pc platforms that was
     posted on the inferno-list see the <a href="http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-08&m=2264059">'Inferno emu</a>
     <a href="http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-08&m=2264059">with Linux framebuffer support'</a> message and can be
     easily addapted to work with T3Â¸ see the <a href="http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-11&m=2663182">'using</a>
     <a href="http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-11&m=2663182">Inferno on Palm'</a> message on inferno-list too.

     The advantage is that you don't need an X server
     and all it's deps on such a small device you just
     launch the emu-fb from the console. On the
     drawbacks are that you loose the hability to lauch
     ps/pdf viewers like gv/xpdf, anyway i haven't
     found gv/postscript interpreters on Familiar, i
     guess it's too much bloated for small devices.

     The audio support could be done by using the
     legacy OSS interface, there's emulation of it from
     ALSA, because many old programs still rely on it,
     which i send to the inferno-list with the subject
     <a href="http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-10&t=2432767">'devaudio for Linux'</a> so audio support can be
     easily added.

     The next thing was having a WM/GUI suitable for
     such small screen dimensions but by using the rio
     like <a href="http://www.caerwyn.com/ipn/2004/12/lab-19-wm.html">wm/wm</a> from caerwyn, works fine.

     And creating a nice <a href="http://caerwyn.com/lab/67/user/guide">guide</a> file with the frequently
     launched commands, i.e. play music, raise/lower
     audio volume, toggle backlight, etc.

     This guide can be opened with acme -c1 -l
     acme.dump, started by default from <a href="http://caerwyn.com/lab/67/user/lib/wmsetup">wmsetup.</a>

     Only recommendation is that to take advantatge of
     the small screen space available is a good
     practice to keep the names of files/directories
     short so they can fit in one like in the Acme
     editor. And a nice thing is that you can even do
     snarfing and chording easily with the stylus.

     If you haven't heard about rio, acme and plumber
     before, take a careful read to the Plan 9 papers
     in the REFERENCES section.

  <b>Experiments</b>
     <i>9pod:</i> (kind of 9pod, like it was said some time
     ago on 9fans.)

     <i>voip:</i> 	one thing that i would like to be able to
     do is to be able to share 	the audio device '#A'
     with a remote computer (for start just one), this
     will 	allow me to be able to talk with other
     people, over the net, i know that there're 	are a
     lot of projects out there that already give you
     that, but i wanted something 	simple thus, the
     most simple that i could think was:
     <b>styxlisten tcp!firulillo!styx export '#A';</b>
     <b>mount tcp!firulillo!styx /n/remote;</b>
     <b>stream /dev/audio /n/remote/audio;</b>

     	The above example sort of works, only drawback is
     that sound is played slow 	on a 100Mb LAN
     connection between two Linux hosts running Inferno
     emu. 	So the next refinement could be to compress
     the data before sending 	it and decompress on
     receiving it:
     <b>cat /n/local/home/salva/.mpd/music/misc/mymymy.mp3 | </b>
     <b>	os madplay -Q -o wave:- - | wav2iaf | auplay -</b>

<b>NOTES</b>
     1.   A list of handhelds's running Linux, the
          status of the ports and hardware list can be
          consulted at <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/SupportedHandheldSummary">supported handhelds</a>

     2.   This talk is about T3, changes to run Inferno
          emu on another handheld model will be left
          intentionally as an exercise to the
          interested reader.
