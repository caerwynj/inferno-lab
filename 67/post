.SH NAME
Inferno emu on Palm Tungsten T3
.I (and under similar palm handhelds, see notes).

.SH DESCRIPTION
This lab collects some personal/informal notes that I took while 
setting up setup Inferno emu running hosted on a T3, 
the main reasons for doing this are:
.IP 1.
Wanted to experiment with 
.A http://www.vitanuova.com Inferno
.IP 2.
Get tired of the 'traditional' way of using a computer and by extension
a handheld (both POS and Linux), and wanting to employ my time in more useful things.
.IP 3.
after some time using Inferno i've noticed that it has all i need, and the pieces
that Inferno doesn't have (ogg, mp3, etc.) can be borrowed from the host OS (Linux).

.PP
The first section covers the hardware available on the T3,
the second section talks about how to setup Linux on the T3,
and finishes talking about the setup of Inferno itself to perform
some typical tasks, which includes brief notes on how to compile
and run emu on T3.

.SS Hardware
I'm going to center in the hardware that is currently 
.A http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/PalmTungstenT3Status supported
under Linux, and hence available for Inferno hosted, there are some good reviews
about the T3 one that it's worth mention is 
.A http://www.pspilot.de/ppptun3/ppptun3.html ppptun3
.

In summary we can use:
.IP -
SD card support for storage
.IP -
a nice 320x480 TFT LCD for graphics
.IP -
audio support both for playing and recording
.IP -
and buttons and touchscreen for input
.IP -
networking: we have are usb (usbnet), IR (not tested, but should work)
and BT (not working due to lack of specs).

It's important to note that T3 as the other palm handhelds have reset features
that are useful to recover of some errors, you can read about at
.A http://www.tankerbob.com/palm/resets.htm resets.

.SS Setting up Linux
.SS Booting
The procedure for booting Inferno can be sumarized in:
.EX
1) boot POS (default from ROM) ->
2)	run Garux (from SD Card, 1st partition FAT16) ->
3)		start Linux (using rootfs from 1st partition of SD Card) ->
4)			start Inferno emu-fb (from a /etc/init.d/inferno script)
.EE

As Garux is run from Palm OS (POS), the SD card
where garux is stored needs to be recognized from POS,
which has a FAT16, hence maximum tested SD card size is 1Gb.

This 1Gb SD card can be partitioned the following way,
.IP
.I part1
FAT16 30Mb, to store garux and the rootfs,
kernel modules and other files needed to boot Linux.
.IP
.I part2
ext3 970Mb, to store Inferno and media (audio,docs,...).

.PP
All the files and a small howto with instructions on how to boot Linux
on a T3 can be found at 
.A http://trac.hackndev.com/projects/palmt3/wiki/ t3\ linux
On the same place there's a guide to flash the SmallRom partition which holds
the POS bootloader, to be able to suspend/resume the T3, otherwise you have to
reset the handheld each time you want to power off and
booting again takes it's time.

.SS Setting up Inferno
Given the hardware available on T3 (and handhelds in general) it's wise
to keep the system as small and simple as possible. 
So the hardware devices are managed by the linux kernel, which provices
access to them through the
.B /dev/
devices;
.B /dev/fbX
for the graphics frame buffer,
.B /dev/input/eventX
for input events (touchscreen and keys) and 
.B /dev/dsp
for audio.
This devices can be managed by the emu-fb version written by Alexander Syschev
for the iPAQ 3970 (arm) and pc platforms that was posted on the inferno-list see the 
.A http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-08&m=2264059 '"Inferno emu with Linux framebuffer support"'
message and can be easily addapted to work with T3Â¸ see the 
.A http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-11&m=2663182 '"using Inferno on Palm"'
message on inferno-list too.

The advantage is that you don't need an X server and all it's deps
on such a small device you just launch the emu-fb from the console.
On the drawbacks are that you loose the hability to lauch ps/pdf viewers like gv/xpdf,
anyway i haven't found gv/postscript interpreters on Familiar, i guess it's too much bloated
for small devices.

The audio support could be done by using the legacy OSS interface,
there's emulation of it from ALSA, because many old programs still rely on it,
which i send to the inferno-list with the subject
.A http://archive.netbsd.se/?ml=Inferno-discussion&a=2006-10&t=2432767 '"devaudio for Linux"'
so audio support can be easily added.

The next thing was having a WM/GUI suitable for such small screen dimensions
but by using the rio like 
.A http://www.caerwyn.com/ipn/2004/12/lab-19-wm.html wm/wm
from caerwyn, works fine.

And creating a nice 
.A http://caerwyn.com/lab/67/user/guide guide
file with the frequently launched commands, i.e. play music, raise/lower audio volume,
toggle backlight, etc.

This guide can be opened with acme -c1 -l acme.dump, started by default from 
.A http://caerwyn.com/lab/67/user/lib/wmsetup wmsetup.

Only recommendation is that to take advantatge of the small screen space available
is a good practice to keep the names of files/directories short so they can fit in
one like in the Acme editor. And a nice thing is that you can even do snarfing and
chording easily with the stylus.

If you haven't heard about rio, acme and plumber before, take a careful read
to the Plan 9 papers in the REFERENCES section.

.SS Experiments

.PP
.IR 9pod:
(kind of 9pod, like it was said some time ago on 9fans.)
.PP
.IR voip:
	one thing that i would like to be able to do is to be able to share
	the audio device '#A' with a remote computer (for start just one), this will
	allow me to be able to talk with other people, over the net, i know that there're
	are a lot of projects out there that already give you that, but i wanted something
	simple thus, the most simple that i could think was:
.EX
styxlisten tcp!firulillo!styx export '#A';
mount tcp!firulillo!styx /n/remote;
stream /dev/audio /n/remote/audio;
.EE

.IR
	The above example sort of works, only drawback is that sound is played slow
	on a 100Mb LAN connection between two Linux hosts running Inferno emu.
	So the next refinement could be to compress the data before sending 
	it and decompress on receiving it:
.EX
cat /n/local/home/salva/.mpd/music/misc/mymymy.mp3 | 
	os madplay -Q -o wave:- - | wav2iaf | auplay -
.EE

.SH NOTES
.IP 1.
A list of handhelds's running Linux, the status of the ports and hardware
list can be consulted at 
.A http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/SupportedHandheldSummary supported\ handhelds
.IP 2.
This talk is about T3, changes to run Inferno emu on another
handheld model will be left intentionally as an exercise to the interested reader.
