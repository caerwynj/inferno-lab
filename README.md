Inferno Programmer's Notebook

This is the source code from the [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn/com)

Each entry, when it describes a programming session in Inferno OS, should include at least the following.

- purpose; what I hope to get done in the session
- apparatus and settings; so someone else could reproduce what I've done
- diary; record of actions and results
- analysis and conclusions

I use inferno for fun. the lab sessions took place at home, in the evenings, usually Monday to Friday, 9:00pm to 11:30pm. This wasn't always enough time to get things done, so some of the tasks may seem quite trivial.

I wanted the labs to cover a wide range of subjects, to cross over disciplinary boundaries, to go wherever my interest took me. Inferno offered a good environment to do this work, for a variety of reasons explored in the labs.
