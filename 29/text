.SH NAME
lab 29 - embedded graphs
.SH DESCRIPTION
Taking inspiration from 
.IR Mathematica 's 
notebook user interface, I tried implementing graphs
embedded within the shell window, 
.IR wm/sh . 
The idea being that a scrolling page
of graphs, text and images is easier to manage than many overlapping
windows. I feel this especially while I'm iteratively running commands,
generating data and viewing graphs.
.PP
The shell window provides a history of activity. By including other windows
in that history
I can look back at the graphs I generated, what data generated them, 
what command was used to generate the data, and so on. With
overlapping windows this context can be lost. 
.PP
.I Wm/sh
used in this way now behaves as a rudimentary window manager. 
It is easy to imagine ways in which it becomes inconvient to use. Such
as interacting with two windows separated
by a large block of text. But it still might add a useful alternative to the
.I wm/wm
and 
.I acme
window manager styles.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The graphs are Tk windows embedded within the text of the shell window.
The graph can respond to events,
and in this case clicking inside the graph updates the displayed coordinates.
.PP
I didn't know how to do any of this, or even that Tk made it possible,
until I looked at the editor 
.IR wm/brutus .
.I Brutus
seems to be a forgotten application
within Inferno and not very stable. It supports
embedding of images, tables, and excerpts of code within
the text and simple formatting. 
It is still useful to
trawl through such programs for snippets of code.
Finding the code to embed Tk windows within text was enlightening.
.PP
I used the brutus extension interface
.B brutusext.m
to implement the graph module. The graph module itself
was adapted from
.BR /appl/math/gr.b .
.PP
The shell already comes with a file system inteface
.B /chan/shctl
to communicate with external programs.
I added to 
.I wm/sh 
two commands to be recognized by this file.
.IP
.EX
% echo graph filename > /chan/shctl
.EE
.PP
where
.I filename
contains a set of coordinates. 
.I Wm/sh 
displays a graph within the shell window.

.PP
I also added a command to display images. For example,
.IP
.EX
% echo bitmap /icons/coin.bit > /chan/shctl
.EE
.PP
To clear memory from all the Tk objects created,
.IP
.EX
% echo clear >/chan/shctl
.EE
.SH SUMMARY
.PP
By adding this feature many other possibilities and questions
quickly arise. How can we collapse individual embedded windows?
Can we cut and paste the embeds? What about saving the whole
contents of the shell window, including embeds, and restoring
them later for browsing.
.I Wm/brutus 
again points the way to doing some of this, by
creating a simple markup using SGML or sexprs to store
the contents as an expression.
