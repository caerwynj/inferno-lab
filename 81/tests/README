evtest: to see the sequence of events generated by /dev/event0 and /dev/event1.
maxlloc: to find out the max contiguous size given by malloc -> mmap -> kmalloc
	which is a maximum of 2MB, hack kmalloc_sizes.h to include 4MB?
conlloc: to check if it's possible to alloc 4MB contiguous as 2MB + 2MB contiguous,
	and is not possible.

alternatives:
1) see how fb code works for inferno-fb/microwindows and try to do it in less memory?
2) use the mallocs from uClibc
3) mmap, can't replace sbrk, as sbrk manages (increments) the segment break,
	which is contiguous, while multiple calls to mmap return non contiguous memory.
