Polyphony
-----
We'd like say 12 Note polyphony
across all channels.

All channels are the same voice
so we could ignore voice.

When we keyon for a note
we need to remember which 
inst we used so we can send the
keyoff to the right one.

But if that inst has already been
used for another note, we
must ignore the keyoff.

We need a map for the keyon pitch
to the inst.
