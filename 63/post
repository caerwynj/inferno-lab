lab 63 - Calendar for acme
<p>
I wrote a little calendar client for acme based on Inferno's wm/calendar(1).
It uses rawdbfs(1) in the same way to store calendar entries. 
<p>
The calendar window displays a calendar much like cal(1) and has commands <i>Next</i> and <i>Prev</i> to move between months. Days that have calendar entries have a plus superscript symbol. Right click on the days of the month to open and edit a calendar entry.
<p>
To use it make sure you have a directory /mnt/schedule, and a file in your home directory called, schedule.
<pre>
mkdir /mnt/schedule
touch schedule
Calendar schedule
</pre>
<p>
Or
<pre>
Local rawdbfs schedule /mnt/schedule
Calendar
</pre>
