lab 18 - mux
.SH DESCRIPTION
Much of my recent reading has led me back to various
implementations of a multiplexer. This is an important and powerful
abstraction and I want to understand it better. I know very little about
it now.
I'd like to implement
one in limbo, for example to multiplex the link between sam and samterm
as suggested in the 
.A http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/cyoung/papers/hotos-final.pdf   protium 
paper. Hence my interest in sam in the earlier lab.
.PP
Here is a some of the things I've been reading recently about multiplexers.
See if you notice a pattern.
J. Hickey's Master thesis at MIT implements
.A http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/papers/plan9:jmhickey-meng.pdf mux
for plan9 which puts a 9p multiplexer into user space and provides
asynchonous IO for user threads.
.PP
Search 9fans for
.A http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=multiplexing&meta=group%3Dcomp.os.plan9 multiplexing
where there is some interesting discussion on the use of multiplexers in plan9.
.PP
For example, an

9p multiplexing and

9p multiplexing.

See also an implementation of a generic rpc multiplexer, libmux, in
.A http://swtch.com/plan9port plan9port
.PP
The various window systems by Rob Pike, mux, 8Â½, and rio are multiplexers
for their environment, the screen, mouse and keyboard.
.PP
The spree game engine is a multiplexer at the application level
for the object hierarchy managed by the server.
.PP
And in inferno
.B /emu/port/devmnt.c
is the multiplexer for 9p.
.PP
In the original 
.A http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/papers/hotos-jeremiad.ps exokernel 
paper the authors argued the principal
function of an operating system is to multiplex access to hardware,
and should do nothing else. Multiplexers are vital to providing
9p service and in protium the authors argue they are a vital
piece of infrastructure for distributed applications. 
.PP
In summary, this is something I need to learn more about.
I'll proceed in these labs with studying the code to libmux
and devmnt and try to implement the mux for the sam session.
