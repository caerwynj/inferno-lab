Subject: cryptfs

i implemented a simple (naive?) cryptfs
using file2chan to interpose
cryptography between, say, disk/kfs and
its storage.

the code is available at my blog,
http://caerwyn.home.comcast.net/ipn
which is all about inferno :)

i may have missed something obvious in
the implementation making it hopelessly
insecure.  If so, I'd like to hear about
it.

what is amazing to me is how easy this
was to do.  from thinking of the idea
while driving home, to coding it that
evening, and have it work, was only a
few hours.  only in inferno.
