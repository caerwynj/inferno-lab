# Inferno Programmer's Notebook 2nd Edition

> Lightning flashes, Sparks shower. In one blink of your eyes You have missed seeing. *Gateless Gate*

Inferno OS is an operating system developed by Bell Labs in the 1990's.
This site is a collection of software, articles, and archives for
all things related to Inferno OS.

During the 2000s I wrote a blog about using Inferno called [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn.com).
I used Inferno for fun. I wanted my experiments to cover a wide range of subjects in computing, and I wanted a system that would help me go wherever my interest took me.
It turned out that Inferno was a good place to work. 
It was a comprehensive system
from running natively on hardware to desktop GUI with virtual machine, language compiler, tools and filesystems in between.
At the same time it was still small and simple enough to be understood by one person.
In some ways it fulfilled the vision of the Oberon system, but still firmly belonging to the UNIX tradition.

On this site I will be updating a revised edition of that blog, reorganized and expanded with new material. 

While today Inferno would be considered a retro operating system, maybe a footnote in the history of Unix, it still contains something that interests me and pulls me in; to once again explore
and experiment.
