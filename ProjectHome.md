This is the source code from the [Inferno Programmer's Notebook](http://ipn.caerwyn.com)

The wiki contains an [Index](Index.md) of labs so far.

Each entry, when it describes a programming session in Inferno, should include at least the following.

  * purpose; what I hope to get done in the session
  * apparatus and settings; so someone else could reproduce what I've done
  * diary; record of actions and results
  * analysis and conclusions

I use inferno for fun. the sessions I describe take place at home, in the evenings, usually Monday to Friday, 9:00pm to 11:30pm. This isn't always enough time to get things done, so some of the tasks may seem quite trivial.

I want labs to cover a wide range of subjects in computer science, to cross over disciplinary boundaries, to go wherever my curiosity takes me. I hope to experiment a little, learn a lot, and, just maybe, discover something new. Inferno presents a good environment to do this work, for a variety of reasons I'll explore in the labs.

If you like the idea join the lab.
