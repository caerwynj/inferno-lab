.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a light lab about some useful day-to-day tools,
mainly language and music playing tools.

.I gask
is a simple script for doing searches with google, which is nice when you want
to consult something while writting a text, it returns the output in textual form
so it can be used/plumbed etc.

.PP
the next tools are for rapidly looking definitions in english/spanish/...
on a dictionary, and they're handy when you aren't a native speaker.

.I trgg
.I (translate google)
allows you to translate between any pair of languages that are supported by google,
the usage of the command is 
.EX
trgg 'sl|dl' text, or piped |trgg 'sl|dl' where:
	sl: is the source language (by default english)
	dl: is the destination language (by default spanish)
.EE

.PP
while
.I dorg
does a search on the dictionaries using the services of www.dict.org site,

.PP
.IR drae
is is an interface to the "Real Academia de la Lengua" dictionary,
so you can consult the meaning of spanish words.

.PP
And last but not least
there's the google's
.B "define:"
keyword, that looks on the web for definitions 
of the arguments provided.

For interacting with google's services HTTP POST request support is needed,
we can find it in webfsget as in the 
.A http://caerwyn.com/ipn/2004/12/lab-24-google-api.html google-api
lab, but we can also get it from hget.c and incorporate
it to webgrab with a [-p post] option. That's the aproach followed.

.I oggplay, madplay and audio,
those three scripts are used to play music in the mp3 and ogg formats,
for writting them i've needed to modify 
.IR wav2iaf(1)
and 
.IR auplay(1)
to work with data piped to it's standard input and write the result to
it's standard output. And last audio is a small utility to query/set the parameters
of 
.B /dev/audioctl.

With this rules it's very easy to set up a few plumbing rules, to handle music files.
