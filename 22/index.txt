NAME
     lab 22 - new aggregator

DESCRIPTION
     This lab is just text copied from my homepage. I'm cutting
     and pasting it to clean up my homepage and keep all my lab
     type experiments in one place.

     Rssget downloads an RSS xml file indexes it into tickfs.
     Then using tickquery, which should be copied into 
     /dis/svc/httpd you can query the RSS aggregator using
     address http://localhost/magic/tickquery.

     % mkdir rss
     % cd rss
     % mount -c {tickfs} /n/rss
     % touch /n/rss/index /n/rss/desc /n/rss/chan /n/rss/title
     % svc/httpd/httpd&

     use localcron  to call rssget periodically on your favourite
     news feeds.

     tickquery looks if the first keyword begins with 'date:' the
     rest of the word is treated as a rng(1) and restricts the
     results to within the date range.

     For example, to search for RSS entries since 1st of the
     current month mentioning google
     date:1, google
     or show me all entries collected on the 21st of the current
     month
     	date:21

     Here is a of this service.

     more interesting examples I have yet to work out. it gets
     more interesting given temporal indexes of mail, mailing
     lists, rss feeds, stock ticker, visited web pages, images
     and annotations of local files and links. then a context
     around a particular event can be constructed...
