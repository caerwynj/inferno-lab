NAME
     lab 23 - annotating a file system

DESCRIPTION
     This lab was cut and pasted from my homepage. It is not new.

     i have tried out some experiments with annotating the
     filesystem; really, several iterations of the same idea. 

     my latest attempt is tickfs, which i think comes close to
     doug mcilroy's of a metadata file system.

     each file served by <b>tickfs</b> is a binary relation, the
     key is usually an absolute pathname, and the attribute is
     defined by the name of the relation.  each relation is also
     bi-temporal.  it's a historical record of changes to each
     key, value pair and it determines whether a key, value pair
     is true at a given time.

     adding metadata is simple
     	% echo ${quote i . /doc/sh.ms 'the inferno shell' } > /n/tickfs/desc
     	% echo ${quote i . /doc/sh.ms 'rogger peppe' } > /n/tickfs/author
     the dot indicates the current time, but any time represented
     as seconds since the epoch can be given.

     queries are pipelines
     	% 9ls sh.ms |taq /n/tickfs/author |taq -j /n/tickfs/desc
     the query uses the timestamp of the files to return the
     currently effective values for the attributes 'author' and
     'desc'.

     it relies on a disciplined user to maintain a single logical
     namespace and to keep it consistent with the namespace of
     keys within tickfs.  plan9 and inferno make it easy to alter
     the namespace; but the discipline of arranging a clear,
     consistent namespace is harder.

     an example that includes fossil is to bind a directory from
     dump over the logical namespace.  the currently effective
     values will likely vary over time, and so obtain different
     results from tickfs.
             % 9ls /doc |taq /n/tickfs/desc
             % bind /n/dump/2004/0101/doc /doc
             % 9ls /doc |taq /n/tickfs/desc

     also, i have tried indexing file contents within
     <b>tickfs</b>, so combinations of keyword search and named
     descriptors can be used
     	% search bug |taq /n/tickfs/author |grep caerwyn |taq /n/tickfs/desc

     tickfs runs on inferno, but lookfs, which is an earlier
     iteration using libstyx, is very similar and should run on
     plan9.
