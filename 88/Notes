Add a devmods device to emu that exports

lib/sys.dis
lib/draw.dis

etc. for every module built into the kernel.

The files have no permissions to read or write.
Each file has a unique qid, which the kernel can
check when it loads each module so that
an actual load never occurs, the builtin
modules are always already resident.

However, if a user binds a real .dis file ontop of
of builtin, then it will get loaded. This is
so we can emulate older versions of emu.

We can also add limbo implementations of
what were builtin modules, such as prefab,
tk, draw, math, or keyring, or we can
supplement the builtins.


The ability to do this proves whether we can provide
a sustainable environment.

The load command will map $Mod names to 
the path /dev/lib/mod.dis


We have the limbo source for a limbo compiler back
to 1e.

We have complete source file trees from 1e, 2e, 3e, 4e, and current.
