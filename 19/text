lab 19 - understanding wmclient
.SH DESCRIPTION
In trying to understand 
.IR wm (1)
and its supporting libraries
.IR wmclient (2), 
.IR tkclient (2), 
and titlebar, I modified them to resemble
(if you squint) rio. I haven't adopted rio's menus or button
controls.

I began with a copy of wmclient. I wanted to peel away the layers
between the application and wm. I removed the dependency on
titlebar and created a border that would manage the window.
I removed whatever else I thought was unneccessary. I ended 
up with 
.I myclient
which talks directly to wm. 

Window management is based on button clicks on the border.
Button 1 moves , button 2 reshapes, and button 3 deletes the window.

I liked the window management so I wanted to use that
for all windows. To copy the border changes back to
wmclient.b was easy.

But most windows programs in inferno use the tkclient.
For that I needed to modify the titlebar. I created four
buttons which fill the four edges of the rectangle.
Each button is bound to the three buttons which control
the window management.

I made the color of the borders different for tkclients and wmclients.
There aren't many wmclients: acme and wm.

The borders  change color when the window gains
or loses keyboard focus, but it must accept kbd input
for this to happen.

.I wmclient 
creates a new window with a transparent
image, so it's filled with whatever
is beneath it. This leads to an obvious tool
.I grab
to capture and image of a part of the desktop.
Reshape the window to grab the part of the picture
then click button 1 in the image and it writes it to 
the file named on the command line to grab.

.SH CONCLUSION
I like the results. I'll probably use this going forward
and see what other mouse bindings I like. But this 
leads me to modify the tk for commands like sh etc., 
tweaking everything.

For some reason wm/sh calls a Tk command which
refers back to the titlebar assuming the .Wm_title
exists. So I included a modified wm/sh.

I'm tempted to make more mods to wm/sh to remove
the menus and make it more like and acme window, that is,
middle click sends, which is really the only menu option I ever use.
