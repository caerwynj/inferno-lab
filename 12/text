.SH NAME
lab 12 - implement an oscilloscope for signals from
signalfs.
.SH DESCRIPTION
I implemented an oscilloscope called
.I scope 
to view the signals produced by signalfs,
or other PCM data such as an iaf file
stripped of it's header.
.IP
.EX
% scope < bach.raw > /dev/null
.EE
.PP
It writes it's input to it's output, but it
doesn't sound very good if directed
to 
.BR /dev/audio .
It writes small blocks of samples
with small delays between writes, 
making it sound very choppy.
.PP
.I Scope
tries to draw 25 frames a second, getting
a tick from a timer, and reads 1/25th 
of a second of samples from the input,
then draws it on a Tk panel.
.PP
This is 
.I might
be  useful when
recording input from a microphone
.IP
.EX 
% scope < /dev/audio > out.raw
.EE
.PP
It takes as parameter the sample rate
and number of channels, stereo or mono.
.SH CONCLUSION
Not being able to listen and see the waveform
at the same time makes it less useful. How do
we keep in sync the visual and audio streams?
.PP
I'd like to present a similar graph using the FFT,
but I keep getting errors from the fft module. It correctly
does the transform but isn't able to permute
the numbers into normal order (I think, I
do not know enough about this.)
Commenting out the 
"optional code"
in
.B /appl/math/fft.b
seemed to make it work, at least make it not exit.
