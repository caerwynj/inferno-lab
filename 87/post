lab 87 - mux for nintendo ds
<p>
In an earlier post I talked about <a href="http://caerwyn.com/ipn/2006/02/lab-54-mux-for-4th-edition.html">updating mux to 4th edition Inferno</a>
in the hope of one day running it on a Nintendo DS.
<p>
Well, Inferno is now booting on the DS so I got to try it for real.
<p>
I started with getting the mux window manager working
in standard inferno. Then I changed the resolution down to 256x192
and tried to get everything to fit.  The files in this lab include the 
version of mux I ended up putting in the <a href="http://caerwyn.com/downloads/ipds1.nds">nds file</a> running on the DS.
<p>
Things to try if you download it.  Rocker moves up and down selection.
'A' key enters, 'B' key backs out back up to the higher level.
'Start' key returns to the top level menu.
<p>
Try Today's Newspaper, and The Thisburgh has the only working graphic.
Under news, click through to actually read an article.  Under games,
try connect4.  Audio control would look cool if any of the graphics
actually came in.  The Financial Reports gives a ticker.  It scrolls
slowly only because of the sleep interval in the code is incorrect.
<p>
If you want to try this version of mux using using hosted inferno
just remember you need to compile prefab into your emu. 
Include prefab in the mod and lib sections of your emu config file,
also uncomment prefab in the /libinterp/mkfile.
<p>
Mux uses <a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/man/2/ir.html">irsim</a> for key controls. I changed my local inferno-ds code to have the DS keys output
the same characters as used by irsim. 
<p>
The files in this lab include the movies and tvlist apps.
These didn't fit on the 4MB .nds file. But they will fit when we get the GBA ROM
or dldi interface working.
<p>
I think mux is a good path to follow for DS development.  Its
small, starts quickly, uses the keys effectively since it was designed
for remote controls, the programs are easy to understand, and they hit
most of the applications I'd like to start with, small games, news
reader, email reader, simple database browser (movies, tvlist), and
audio.
