Pizza menus must fit on a TV screen of 640 by 480 pixels.
Information should not get closer than ten pixels from the edges.
Essentially, the menu displays should be such that things
can be selected from them by pointing to them and bringing up
new menus (submenus).

Selection in menus is on the basis of rectangles.  Every
selectable item should be placed such that a rectangle
can be drawn around it whose edge is entirely on the white
background of the menu.

Change `Pizza Villa' into `Mom's Pizza'.  The logo is just fine.
It should probably appear on every menu somewhere.

Layout can be anything you like.  To indicate choosable items
I've included them in brackets [like this].

The main menu should have some welcoming message and allow
people to choose from one of the submenus (everything that's
indented from the left margin is part of a menu):

main menu:
	Welcome to Mom's Pizza

	We deliver orders anywhere in
	the world*

	What would you like:

	   [You Choose, Surprise me! $13.99]

	[Pan Pizza]		[Starter]
	[Thin'n'Crispy]		[Side dishes]
	[Stuffed Crust Pizza]	[Beverage]

	Check out our [Family Specials]!

	Hit the SUR key on your remote control
	for operating instructions

	* Except Antarctica

The footnote should be in a size that makes it only barely legible.

After some items have been selected, a page should appear that
lists the order and gives the total price.  We'll compose that
page from rectangles containing item names and numbers.
We need a header saying something like:

	Mom's Pizza

	To change your order, select the item,
	type the number (zero to delete the
	item) and hit Enter.

	You have ordered:

and a trailer saying:

	Subtotal:
	Tax:
	Total:
	
	[I want to order more]

	[My order is complete]

We'll fill in an address and a number of minutes.  The address
has no known vertical size, so it shouldn't be boxed in.

We also need images containing the digits 0 through 9, a
dollar sign, and a period.  With these we'll make up the prices.

This particular menu will often grow to be taller than the screen.
We'll make it scroll up and down.
