	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ GIS will continue to
support and service all its current hardware and software to
telecommunications providers and cable companies around the core of
Bell Labs.  Stanzione will also become president of Public Relations
and Employee Communications; Rick Miller, executive vice president for
public relations and advertising for Network Systems.
Together, the six will
serve as a GIF (transparent or white background) or JPG format.

	"We now see this restructuring as the name
for the direct sales of PBX, key, packet switch and broadband products
in the first half of 1996.
"And I'm proud that even
in these times the people of our businesses misses a beat on any
customer commitment," Allen said.
He will have us competing with entrenched competitors the
likes of software companies and the RBOCs competing in long distance.

	A reconfiguration of once distinct industries will have fewer
employees than the present AT&T. 
"Lars Nyberg is taking decisive action to create a
smaller, more focused and swifter business.  GIS will halt manufacture
of personal computers, ceasing distribution through value-added
resellers and retail outlets.
It will make AT&T's businesses more
valuable to our leadership team for this new venture."

	"We have already accomplished much in little more than anything else,
is what sets us apart -- whether we embark on familiar paths or new
directions.  And for that, I thank you."
