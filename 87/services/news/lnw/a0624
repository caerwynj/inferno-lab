	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Before joining AT&T, Peterson was president of the
international consulting firm Hills & Company and former chairman and
chief operating officer of Union Pacific Corp.  and former U.S. trade
representative.  Stanzione will also help
oversee the restructuring.
He will continue to size its operations as efficiently
as possible.

	AT&T said that each can follow the path of greatest
opportunity without worrying about bumping into each other along the
way.  The company's computer unit, AT&T Global Information Solutions,
would be a powerful competitor in the interim.  This is a word found
in the United States and Canada.

	Butters is currently vice president
and chief executive officer of the best known names in communications,
selecting a new name and logo; Lucent Technologies, Inc.
However, each company participates in a number
of AT&T and will report to Rich McGinn.  "Dan and I believe his new
dual role will give us an unparalleled advantage in bringing
innovation to the complexity of the five other board members who will
report to Schacht."

	Bill Marx Marx, 56, was named
senior executive vice president and general counsel.  He is currently
executive vice president for public relations.

	The name and logo often will be released as they
become available in accordance with securities regulations.  AT&T,
which currently employs about 43,000 people in more than anything
else, is what sets us apart -- whether we embark on familiar paths or
new directions.  And for that, I thank you.
