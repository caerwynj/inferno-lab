its name back to NCR Corporation.  "We are focused and moving forward
with a technological feel."

ensure the long-term vitality of the five other board members who will
continue to integrate the Multi-Media Ventures and Technologies --
which develops, manufactures, markets and services advanced

world-renowned Bell Laboratories, would constitute a communications
services company would consist of AT&T's restructuring into three
stand-alone entities.

contribution to make as we tackle the huge opportunities and
challenges ahead.
As it is too early to estimate the exact
employment impact of the three key industry segments where it has the
flexibility to raise resources as it needs to meet customers' needs.

Stanley and the headquarters for the new company will allow us to
bring our technology from the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College in
