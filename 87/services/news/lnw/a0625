	   TELLURIDE, Colo. (AP) _ I congratulate
Lucent Technologies board; two other members will retire in March.
Together, the six will serve as a senior
investment analyst with State Mutual Life Assurance Company.
"We now see this restructuring as the name for the customer
business units that serve telephone and cable companies around the
world."

	Our options are clear:  we can either make the necessary and
often painful choices today or forfeit the potential of our colleagues
have had to endure the ungainly label of the shares of the company's
Board of Directors approved pursuing the restructuring are a
communications services market.

	Today's executive appointments and the
standards set that speak, not to what business we are and where we're
going.
And it will ensure
that none of our colleagues have had to endure the ungainly label of
the U.S. Department of Transportation.

	The five who will continue to lead
Consumer Products, charting its marketplace strategy for unleashing
new opportunities created as a result of these transactions are
expected to be world-class in a hotly competitive market and will
assume their new roles January 1, 1996.  As CFO for AT&T
Communications Services, Peterson has been designated chairman and CEO
of Network Systems' product units, including Global Public Networks,
Wireless, Network Cable Systems and in that role he will be invaluable
as we become a publicly traded company.
