.SH NAME
lab 17 - fixup inferno samterm
.SH DESCRIPTION
There's an inferno version of samterm intended for connection
to remote sam running on unix/nt/plan9.
It looks like it hasn't been updated for the latest tkclient interface.
Get it working.
.PP
Simple edits to add 
.B samtk.b:/^tkcmds/ 
and
.B samtk.b:/^cmd/
.PP
One of the bigger changes I made is to spawn a new proc
.B samtk.b:/^tkproc/ 
for each  file to handle  events from
the toplevel chan. This was the quickest way I could think of doing it.
It might be more correct to create arrays of channels like those
already in 
.B samterm.m:/Context:/
but that seemed like a lot more work.
.PP
I use the idiom of returning the pid 
.B samtk.b:711
so I can kill the proc when the file is removed, otherwise the
windows would be left hanging around. I added the 
.I pid
to samterm.m:/pid/
.PP
Menus were placed wrongly when middle or right clicking in an edit window.
.IR Menu (9)
uses 
.I post 
command and takes 
.I x y 
coords.
Read 
.IR bind (9)
it should take
.I %X %Y
so placement is relative to system screen instead of edit window.
.B samtk.b:51,50
.PP
.I Cut
doesn't work. Or rather, 
.I paste 
doesn't work once I've done a 
.IR cut .
.SH CONLUSION
.I Mostly
works. I tried some simple edits, 
opening and closing files.
Mount 
.IR cmd(3)
from different machines to get remote connections
to sam. All files names are relative to the remote sam of course,
not the inferno namespace.
