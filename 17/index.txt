NAME
     lab 17 - fixup inferno samterm

DESCRIPTION
     There's an inferno version of samterm intended for
     connection to remote sam running on unix/nt/plan9. It looks
     like it hasn't been updated for the latest tkclient
     interface. Get it working.

     Simple edits to add samtk.b:/^tkcmds/ and samtk.b:/^cmd/

     One of the bigger changes I made is to spawn a new proc
     samtk.b:/^tkproc/ for each  file to handle  events from the
     toplevel chan. This was the quickest way I could think of
     doing it. It might be more correct to create arrays of
     channels like those already in samterm.m:/Context:/ but that
     seemed like a lot more work.

     I use the idiom of returning the pid samtk.b:711 so I can
     kill the proc when the file is removed, otherwise the
     windows would be left hanging around. I added the pid to
     samterm.m:/pid/

     Menus were placed wrongly when middle or right clicking in
     an edit window. Menu(9) uses post command and takes x y
     coords. Read bind(9) it should take %X %Y so placement is
     relative to system screen instead of edit window.
     samtk.b:51,50

     Cut doesn't work. Or rather, paste doesn't work once I've
     done a cut.

CONLUSION
     Mostly works. I tried some simple edits, opening and closing
     files. Mount cmd(3) from different machines to get remote
     connections to sam. All files names are relative to the
     remote sam of course, not the inferno namespace.
