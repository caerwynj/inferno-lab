.SH NAME
lab 21 - popi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Ported popi from the book 
.I "Beyond Photography - The Digital Darkroom
which is
.A http://spinroot.com/pico/ online
and many of the examples from the book should work.

I took the C code, translated it to limbo, then tried to add the
trig functions and polar coordinates. I referenced Rich Burridge's version of
popi to get ideas while adding the extra features.

See the guide file (if you've mounted this from tcp!canto.hopto.org)
for many of the examples from chapter 3.

The combination of the program and the online text makes a good
example of an active essay. While reading the text the user can
type in the formulas and edit them to explore further into the tool
and it's possibilites. It enhances reading of the text and understanding
of the tool.
.SH CONCLUSION
This took longer to debug than I expected and I still have doubts
about parts of it. The polar coordinates when used as a target
do not work, rounding errors leave gaps in the matrix.

I was going to implement conway's life as a special function
and a method for repeating a transformation so life could be
run on an imported graphic. There are endless possibilities here.

I would like to implement a similar tool for sound wave editing.
I could then plug the resulting waves into signalfs for looping
and components of instruments.
