lab 61 - javascript

In this lab I wanted to get a standalone javascript interpreter for general scripting use within inferno.
<p>
[Deleted a section on reasons why I'd want to do this based on the mix of languages
already available--it's not that interesting.]
<p>
There is already a javascript interpreter in inferno as part of the charon web browser. All I'd need to do is add a small set of host objects to interface with the OS. 
<p>
In this lab I haven't included all the host objects I'd want; not even a fraction. This is just the setup, the beginnings of a javascript tool.
<p>
Suggestions on what the host objects should be are welcome.
<p>
<pre>
% cat t1.js
function f(n) {
	return n * 2;
}

var s;
while((s = System.getline()))
	System.print(s + f(1));

% echo a | js -f t1.js
a
2% 
</pre>
<p>
