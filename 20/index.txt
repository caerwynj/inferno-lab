NAME
     lab 20 - libmux in limbo

DESCRIPTION
     To learn about mux in detail I tried to implement libmux in
     limbo. It actually resembles the mux from libventi more than
     libmux. They are pretty similar.

     I was going to do a detailed description of the mux in
     devmnt but it turns out this has already been done by nemo.

     When I get this working it can be applied to the venti lib
     for session rpc, to build a libfs for direct client 9p
     interaction, bypassing devmnt, and for application protocol
     muxing, say for sam.

     This is a partial implementation. I didn't complete send,
     recv, gettag and settag functions, so this has not been
     tested. I'm just posting it here now  so I don't lose track
     of it. I'll come back to it later, maybe writing more for
     the Venti library or libfs. This is more an excercise to
     understand the workings of libmux and venti's session rpc.
