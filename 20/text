lab 20 - libmux in limbo
.SH DESCRIPTION
To learn about mux in detail I tried to implement libmux in
limbo. It actually resembles the mux from libventi more than libmux.
They are pretty similar.

I was going to do a detailed description of the mux in devmnt
but it turns out this has already been done 
.A http://plan9.escet.urjc.es/usr/nemo/9.txt.gz  here
by nemo.

When I get this working it can be applied
to the venti lib for session rpc, to build a libfs
for direct client 9p interaction, bypassing devmnt,
and for application protocol muxing, say for sam.

This is a partial implementation. I didn't complete
.IR send ,
.IR  recv ,
.I gettag 
and 
.I settag
functions, so
this has not been tested. I'm just posting it here now
 so I don't lose track of it.
I'll come back to it later, maybe writing more for the Venti library
or libfs. This is more an excercise to understand the workings of libmux
and venti's session rpc.
