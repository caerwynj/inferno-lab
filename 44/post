lab 44 - acme irc client
<h2>NOTES</h2><p>
I ported an IRC client originally taken from Russ Cox's code http://swtch.com/irc.tgz written for the Plan9 Acme.
<p>
The code is currently usable, but there is probably plenty of debugging to do. I'll update the code to this lab as I add fxes and append notes to this lab entry with changes made.
